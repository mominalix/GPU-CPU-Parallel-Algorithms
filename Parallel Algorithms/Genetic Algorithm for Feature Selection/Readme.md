# Parallel Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection

This repository contains a Python implementation of a parallel genetic algorithm for feature selection. The algorithm aims to optimize feature subsets for improved machine learning model performance.

## How to Run


1. Install the required dependencies. This code uses NumPy and Multiprocessing:

   ```sh
   pip install numpy
   ```

2. Open the terminal and execute the following command to run the code:

   ```sh
   python genetic_algorithm.py
   ```

## Functionality

The parallel genetic algorithm in this repository aims to perform feature selection for machine learning datasets. Here's how the algorithm works:

1. **Initialization**: A population of binary-encoded feature subsets is generated.

2. **Evaluation**: The fitness of each individual feature subset is evaluated using a predefined fitness function. The fitness function should be replaced with one suitable for your problem domain.

3. **Selection**: Parents for the next generation are selected based on their fitness scores. The probability of selection is based on normalized fitness scores.

4. **Crossover**: Two parents are selected to create two children using crossover at a random point.

5. **Mutation**: The children may undergo mutation, where individual features are flipped with a certain probability.

6. **Next Generation**: The new children replace the old population, creating the next generation.

7. **Repeat**: Steps 2-6 are repeated for a predefined number of generations.

The progress of the algorithm is printed to the terminal, showing the best fitness score for each generation.

## Customize

To adapt the code to your specific problem, follow these steps:

1. Replace the `fitness` function with your actual fitness evaluation function.

2. Adjust the parameters in the script, such as `pop_size`, `num_features`, `generations`, and `mutation_rate`, to suit your requirements.

3. Modify the crossover and mutation functions if needed.
