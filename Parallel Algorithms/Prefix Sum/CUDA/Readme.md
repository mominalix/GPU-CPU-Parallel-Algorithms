# Parallel Prefix Sum (Scan) using CUDA

This repository contains a CUDA implementation of the parallel Prefix Sum (Scan) operation. The Prefix Sum operation takes an array of numbers and generates a new array where each element is the sum of all elements before it in the input array. This implementation leverages the power of GPU parallelism to achieve efficient computation.

## Functionality

The CUDA code provided in this repository performs the following steps:

1. Initializes an input array with sample data.
2. Allocates memory on the GPU for the input and output arrays.
3. Launches a kernel function that performs the parallel Prefix Sum operation.
4. Transfers the result back from the GPU to the CPU.
5. Displays the output array containing the Prefix Sum results.

## Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- NVIDIA CUDA toolkit

## Compiling and Running

To compile and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU and the CUDA toolkit installed on your system.

2. Compile the code using `nvcc` (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler):

   ```bash
   nvcc parallel_prefix_sum.cu -o prefix_sum
   ```

3. Run the compiled executable:

   ```bash
   ./prefix_sum
   ```

4. The output will display the Prefix Sum results generated by the CUDA implementation.
