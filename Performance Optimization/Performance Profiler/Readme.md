# Performance Profiler

This Python script is designed to profile the performance of a given piece of code, providing information about execution time and potential bottlenecks. It's a useful tool for developers to identify areas for optimization.

## Usage

Follow the steps below to compile and run the code:

1. **Run the Script:**
   To execute the script, simply run the `performance_profiler.py` file using the Python interpreter:
   ```bash
   python performance_profiler.py
   ```

2. **Interpreting the Output:**
   After running the script, you will see the following outputs:

   - The execution time of the `slow_function` will be displayed.
   - A detailed profiling report generated by `cProfile` will be printed, showing the cumulative time taken by each function.

## Code Functionality

The script consists of the following key components:

- The `slow_function`: This function simulates a time-consuming task by performing a loop.
- The `main` function: This orchestrates the process.
  - Measures the execution time of `slow_function` using the `time` module.
  - Profiles the execution of `slow_function` using `cProfile`, generating a summary report.

The script demonstrates how to:

- Calculate the execution time of a function using the `time` module.
- Profile code using the built-in `cProfile` module to analyze the time spent in each function.

Feel free to modify the `slow_function` or expand the script to profile your own code snippets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
